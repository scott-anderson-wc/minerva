The raw data is in tables like cgm and insulin_carb.  I will keep it
unchanged, so that later imports/updates are (hopefully) unaffected.

cgm_1 and insulin_carb_1 are the same except that bogus rows are removed.

Create the _1 tables by running the process_1.sql script in pre-process/

cgm_2 and insulin_carb_2 are the same except that timestamps are
regularized as date_time. Once these are derived from *_1, the *_1 tables
can be dropped (though I haven't).

Create the _2 tables by running the process_2.sql script in pre-process/

The _2 tables aren't modified by the iob2.py scripts. That script
creates insulin_carb_smoothed:

If you want to change the structure of ICS (insulin_carb_smoothed), you have to:

1. update the sql/make-insulin_carb_smoothed.sql
2. execute it
3. run iob2.pipe_create_ics()
4. insert-cgm-data.sql
5. run iob2.pipe_update_ics()

Sometimes, it's easier to do ALTER TABLE.
