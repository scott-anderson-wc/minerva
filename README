The raw data is in tables like cgm and insulin_carb.  I will keep it
unchanged, so that later imports/updates are (hopefully) unaffected.

cgm_1 and insulin_carb_1 are the same except that bogus rows are removed.

cgm_2 and insulin_carb_2 are the same except that timestamps are
regularized as date_time. Once these are derived from *_1, the *_1 tables
can be dropped.
